Animation with PLplot: three examples

Example 1: Plot a line piece by piece and pause inbetween

Example 2: Plot a parameterised line, one per page. This requires you to
press the space bar to see the next plot

Example 3: Plot a parameterised line, but to make the animation go on
without any intervention draw the next line in the same page. Steps
to achieve this:
- Blank the inner area (viewport)
- Redraw the axes (slight glitch here - see the tickmarks)
- Draw the new line
